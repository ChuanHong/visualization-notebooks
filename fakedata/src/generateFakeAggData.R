#Fields: siteid, date, new_positive_cases, patients_in_icu, new_deaths
#Notes:
#(1) One row per date (2020-03-15, 2020-03-16, etc.)
#(2) Site is a unique identifier for your institution (e.g., "BIDMC")
#(3) new_positive_cases, patients_in_icu, and new_deaths are number of distinct patients
#(4) If a patient has multiple positive test results, use the earliest date
#(5) Set patients_in_icu = -2 if you do not have ICU data
#(6) Set new_deaths = -2 if you do not have death data
#(7) Obfuscate small counts with "-1" as required by your institution
